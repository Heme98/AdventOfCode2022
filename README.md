# AdventOfCode2022

This is my attempt at solving Advent of Code 2022 in Python. Feel free to take a look and get inspired 

## Helpers

All classes will use some helper functions defined in [Helpers/util.py](https://github.com/Heme98/AdventOfCode2022/blob/main/Helpers/utils.py)

In the code, simply write the following to access the helper functions

```python
import Helpers.utils

```

## TODO

Might add some .sh scripts to automate project structure and other things...
